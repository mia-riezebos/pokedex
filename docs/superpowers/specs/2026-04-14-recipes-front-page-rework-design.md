# Recipes front page rework — discovery improvements

**Date:** 2026-04-14
**Scope:** `recipes-site/` only (the standalone public Next.js site)
**Type:** UX feature; presentational only, no data model or backend changes

## Problem

The public recipes site at `recipes-site/` lands visitors straight into a grid of every approved recipe, sorted by all-time `shareCount` descending. Two discovery modes people actually want are poorly served:

1. **Trending** — what's getting shared *right now*. The current sort buries new momentum under years-old favorites with high cumulative share counts.
2. **New** — what's been added since the last visit. There is no way to see recent additions at all: no sort, no indicator, no "new" badge, and `shareCount` ordering pushes new entries to the bottom.

The page already has search, filter chips, and stats — those work and are not the problem.

## Goals

- Make "trending this week" a first-class, visible part of the page — no clicks required.
- Make "new" the default sort for the main grid, and make newness visible on every card.
- Do not break or regress the existing search, filter, stats, or theme.
- No backend changes. No schema changes. No new network calls.

## Non-goals

- Personalization, "for you" ranking, or any ML-flavored scoring.
- Sort dropdowns, tabs, or view modes. The page should expose two axes (trending + newest) simultaneously with no mode commitment from the user.
- A full redesign. The glassmorphism theme, ambient orbs, stats tiles, search, filter chips, and footer stay as-is.
- Test infrastructure for `recipes-site/`. The site has no test harness today and this spec does not introduce one; pure helpers are extracted to isolated files so they're testable if a harness lands later.
- Any changes to the Discord bot, the `pokedex-mcp` server, or the dashboard.

## Chosen structure: dual-zone layout

The page gets a new "Trending this week" row between the filter chips and the main grid. The main grid then sorts by newest-first instead of popularity.

### Why this shape (not tabs, not smart-feed, not hero)

Tabs make users commit to one view. A smart single feed hides the ranking formula and is hard to tune. A big hero block eats above-the-fold space for a single recipe. The dual-zone layout puts both discovery axes on one scroll, lets each have a clear label, and collapses cleanly when the user takes explicit filtering action.

## Definitions

### "Trending this week"

For each recipe, count entries in `sharedBy[]` whose `sharedAt` is within the last 7 days (`Date.now() - new Date(s.sharedAt).getTime() < 7 * 86400 * 1000`). Sort descending by that count. Take the top 3. Drop any with a count of zero.

The trending row renders only if at least 2 recipes qualify after the drop. A single-item trending row looks broken, so hide the whole section in that case.

**Why not use `updatedAt` as a proxy:** `updatedAt` bumps on any mutation (e.g. a moderator editing tags), not only new shares. We want actual momentum, not "this doc was touched recently."

**Why not use `shareCount` of recipes created in the last 7 days:** that surfaces brand-new popular things but misses older recipes that are getting re-shared — which is exactly the "re-trending" behavior that makes a trending row interesting.

### "Newest"

Main grid sort changes from `shareCount desc` to `createdAt desc`. `createdAt` is a Firestore server timestamp written in `src/services/firestore.js:saveRecipe()` via `FieldValue.serverTimestamp()`.

**Why `createdAt` instead of `updatedAt`:** "new to us" is a clearer mental model than "reddit-style bump on reshare." Users scrolling for new things want entries they haven't seen before, not old entries that resurfaced.

### Relative timestamp on cards

A pure formatter, `formatRelativeTime(value)`, returns one of:

| Age | Returned string |
|---|---|
| < 1 minute | `"just added"` |
| < 1 hour | `"Nm ago"` |
| < 24 hours | `"Nh ago"` |
| < 7 days | `"Nd ago"` |
| < 30 days | `"Nw ago"` |
| ≥ 30 days | `null` |

When the formatter returns `null` the card renders with no timestamp at all — old stuff shouldn't look stale, it should just look neutral.

## Interaction rules

### Search / filter interaction with trending

When any of `search`, `activeTag`, `activeSource` is truthy, **the trending row is hidden entirely**. The user has explicitly signaled intent to narrow the result set; a passive discovery row becomes noise in that state. The main grid filters normally.

When the user clears search and filters, the trending row returns.

### Loading state

The trending row also hides while `loading` is `true`. It renders in the same pass as the main grid once data has loaded.

### Click target

Each trending card links to `recipe.url` in a new tab, same as a regular `RecipeCard`. No modal, no detail page.

## Component architecture

### New: `src/lib/relativeTime.ts`

```ts
export type TimestampLike =
  | Date
  | string
  | { seconds: number; nanoseconds: number }  // serialized Firestore Timestamp
  | { toDate: () => Date }                    // live Firestore Timestamp instance
  | null
  | undefined;

export function formatRelativeTime(value: TimestampLike, nowMs?: number): string | null;
export function isFresh(value: TimestampLike, nowMs?: number): boolean;
```

Both pure. No React, no Firestore imports. Handle every shape `createdAt` can arrive in (live Firestore `Timestamp`, deserialized cache from `localStorage`, or already-normalized `Date`/ISO string). `isFresh` returns `true` when the timestamp is less than 24 hours old — used to apply the green tint on cards, rather than parsing the formatted label string.

### New: `src/lib/trending.ts`

```ts
export interface RecipeWithShares {
  id: string;
  sharedBy?: Array<{ sharedAt?: string }>;
}

export function computeTrending<T extends RecipeWithShares>(
  recipes: T[],
  nowMs?: number,
  windowDays?: number,   // defaults to 7
  limit?: number,        // defaults to 3
): T[];
```

Pure. Takes the full recipe list and returns a slice annotated with the caller's own type. The `nowMs` parameter makes the function deterministic for testing.

### New: `src/components/TrendingRow.tsx`

Client component. Receives the trending slice as a prop, renders 3 gold-tinted cards in a `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3` layout. Each card shows:

- A ghosted rank number (`1` / `2` / `3`) absolute-positioned top-right
- Title (larger than RecipeCard — `text-base` vs `text-sm`)
- Source badge (same color system as RecipeCard)
- `🔥 +N this week` badge instead of total share count
- Gold gradient background to distinguish from the main grid below

Does not fetch. Does not know about Firestore. Takes pre-computed data in, renders it, emits no events.

### Modified: `src/components/RecipeCard.tsx`

Adds a new optional prop: `createdAt?: TimestampLike` (the component already gets the recipe object spread; the cleanest path is to read `createdAt` off the recipe inside the card rather than plumb it as a separate prop).

Renders `formatRelativeTime(createdAt)` in the top-right corner of the card, absolute-positioned next to the existing external-link icon. Base style `text-[10px] text-gray-600`; applies a green tint (`text-emerald-400/70`) when `isFresh(createdAt)` returns `true` (less than 24 hours old), to visually reinforce freshness. When `formatRelativeTime` returns `null` (older than 30 days or missing), the timestamp span is not rendered at all.

### Modified: `src/app/page.tsx`

1. Add `import TrendingRow from "@/components/TrendingRow"` and the helper imports.
2. Change the Firestore query's `orderBy("shareCount", "desc")` to `orderBy("createdAt", "desc")`.
3. Add `createdAt` to the `Recipe` interface as `TimestampLike`.
4. Compute `const trending = useMemo(() => computeTrending(recipes), [recipes])`.
5. Compute `const isFiltering = Boolean(search || activeTag || activeSource)`.
6. Render `<TrendingRow recipes={trending} />` between the filter chips and the grid, gated on `!loading && !isFiltering && trending.length >= 2`.
7. Bump `APP_VERSION` from `"1.0.1"` to `"1.1.0"` so existing localStorage caches invalidate (older cached shapes may lack `createdAt`).

## Cache compatibility

The page uses a localStorage cache with a 60-second TTL and a version string. `Recipe` objects in the cache came through `JSON.stringify`, which turns a Firestore `Timestamp` into `{seconds, nanoseconds}`. `formatRelativeTime` handles that shape. `APP_VERSION` bumps from `"1.0.1"` to `"1.1.0"` so users loading the site for the first time after deploy get a clean fetch instead of a stale cache with the old shape.

## Error handling

No new error paths. All new logic is pure and derived from the data already fetched by the existing `fetchRecipes()`. If that fetch fails, the existing error handling (console.error + loading state) handles both zones — the trending row and the main grid hide together.

If `computeTrending` or `formatRelativeTime` throw on malformed data (they shouldn't — they're defensive), the error propagates to React's error boundary, same as any other render error on the page. No new try/catch.

## Firestore query compatibility

The sort change (`shareCount desc` → `createdAt desc`) is an `orderBy` on a different field, filtered by the same `where("status", "==", "approved")`. This requires a Firestore composite index on `(status ASC, createdAt DESC)`. **Action item:** verify this index exists in the Firebase console before deploying, or the query will fail at runtime with a "missing index" error that includes a one-click link to create it.

If the index is missing at deploy time, the implementation plan should either (a) create it ahead of the deploy, or (b) accept that the first page load will error, click the auto-create link, wait a minute, and retry. Option (a) is preferred.

**Not changing:** `layout.tsx`, `globals.css`, Tailwind config, Firestore rules, the root Discord bot code, `pokedex-mcp`, or `dashboard-vercel`.

## Manual verification plan

Before opening the PR:

1. `cd recipes-site && npm run dev` — open `localhost:3001`
2. Trending row appears above the main grid with 3 cards, gold-tinted, rank numbers visible
3. Type in the search box → trending row disappears
4. Clear search → trending row returns
5. Click a filter chip → trending row disappears
6. Clear chip → trending row returns
7. Recent recipes show a relative timestamp; a recipe under 24 hours old shows it in green
8. Recipes older than 30 days show no timestamp at all
9. Resize to mobile viewport — trending collapses to 1 column and layout still looks right
10. `npm run build` — no TypeScript errors, no ESLint errors
11. Check browser console for Firestore "missing index" errors on the new `createdAt` sort — if present, create the index before merging

## Rollout

Vercel auto-deploys `recipes-site/` from `main` per `recipes-site/vercel.json`. Merge → build → live in ~2 minutes. No feature flag, no staged rollout — the change is purely presentational, reads the same data via the same query, and degrades gracefully on any field that isn't present on older docs.

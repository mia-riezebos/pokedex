      'Every issue now gets a **sequential ticket number** (`#1234`), including MCP reports — shown in triage and the closing receipt',
      'Pokedex now **says it\'s a bot up front**, asks **at most 3 one-at-a-time questions**, and **files early** when it has enough or senses frustration',
      'Triage is **author-aware** — only the original reporter\'s messages count as bug info; anyone can still chime in, and Pokedex ignores mod chatter unless @-mentioned',
